# Express API Validation

### Part One: Getting Started + Adding Validation
- [x] Create your database
- [x] Seed your data.sql file into psql.
- [x] Use JSONSchema to validate the creation and updating of books! Display an error message containing all of the validation errors if book creation or updating fails

### Part Two: Add Tests
- [x] Add integration tests for each of your routes to make sure that the reponse expected is sent.
- [x] Also make sure to set ***process.env.NODE_ENV = "test"*** inside of your test file.
